All notebook files can be run on google colab:

In all colab notebooks or jupyter notebooks just hit and run all to replicate the results.                                                                        
If for some reason an error happend, which didn't happen when i did run them all, try to                                                                       
remove the assert statement that caused the error and the code will continue to work just fine
